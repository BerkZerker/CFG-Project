get game set up on github (eventually)

All card's timers start as soon as they would be able to do their action.
Cards can be played in one of the 3 lanes, and will move up in the queue as 
space allows. Once they have done their action they will be discarded and
added back to the bottom of the deck. 

# add states to the cards.

Slight edit for git testing.

All card's timers start as soon as they would be able to do their action.
Cards can be played in one of the 3 lanes, and will move up in the queue as 
space allows. Once they have done their action they will be discarded and
added back to the bottom of the deck. 


# To do the card's action, idk if it'll be in the card itself, or as a signal to 
the lane telling it that the card's action should be done.

# Then once the action is complete, set the card's state to inactive and put it 
pack into the draw pile (likely an array in the Hand class).

# Then once it enters the hand again, set it's state to "WAITING".


### i may need a 2nd timer for how long the actual action takes.
figure out how cards will handle these two timers 

# Figure out how to handle lane animations. (4 signals sent to the lane class)

# Add card animations

# Clean up last 3 funcs and related signals in card class.

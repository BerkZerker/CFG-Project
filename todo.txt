get game set up on github (eventually)

All card's timers start as soon as they would be able to do their action.
Cards can be played in one of the 3 lanes, and will move up in the queue as 
space allows. Once they have done their action they will be discarded and
added back to the bottom of the deck. 

# add states to the cards.

# use dynamic area2ds and static area2ds for the lanes, and then detect in the 
card script when overlap happens and handle it accordingly.

# The problem with areas is that I just need it to detect the middle point.
...meaning i'll probs not use area2d. Basically just resue my old code.

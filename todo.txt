get game set up on github (eventually)

All card's timers start as soon as they would be able to do their action.
Cards can be played in one of the 3 lanes, and will move up in the queue as 
space allows. Once they have done their action they will be discarded and
added back to the bottom of the deck. 

# add states to the cards.

# Connect signals from the lanes to the base card in Main, so that when a 
card is dragged over a lane it can change it's state to "droppable" and 
when dropped will detach itself from it's parent node, and attack itself to 
the lane node. The lane node will handle it's action from there.
